HR Analytics for Reducing Employee Attrition and Enhancing Retention
Project Overview
This project analyzes an HR dataset to identify key drivers of employee attrition and develop retention strategies to improve employee engagement and loyalty. By leveraging data on employee demographics, job satisfaction, and work environment, the analysis uncovers patterns in turnover and provides actionable recommendations to reduce attrition and foster a positive workplace.
Business Problem
High employee turnover increases recruitment costs, disrupts team dynamics, and impacts productivity.
HR needs data-driven insights to understand why employees leave and how to retain top talent.
Specific Goals
Identify factors contributing to attrition (e.g., age, satisfaction, commute distance).
Highlight characteristics of employees who stay to inform retention strategies.
Approach
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze attrition trends and retention factors using statistical summaries and visualizations.
Predictive Modeling: Build a model to predict attrition and identify key drivers.
Recommendations: Translate insights into HR strategies (e.g., improving work-life balance, targeting high-risk groups).
Tools Used
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
Visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn)

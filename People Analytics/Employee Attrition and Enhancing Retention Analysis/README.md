# HR Analytics for Reducing Employee Attrition and Enhancing Retention

Employee turnover is a significant challenge for organizations, costing millions annually in recruitment, training, and lost productivity. Understanding why employees leave and what keeps them engaged is critical for building a stable, productive workforce. This HR analytics project uses a dataset containing employee information, such as age, job satisfaction, commute distance, and tenure, to address two key questions:

### What drives employee attrition? Are factors like long commutes, low satisfaction, or lack of career growth pushing employees to leave?

### How can we improve retention? What characteristics (e.g., high compensation, training opportunities) are associated with employees who stay?


By analyzing these questions, the project aims to provide HR teams with actionable insights to reduce turnover and enhance employee retention. The analysis includes data exploration, predictive modeling, and visualizations to uncover trends and propose strategies tailored to the organization’s workforce.

* High employee turnover increases recruitment costs, disrupts team dynamics, and impacts productivity.
* HR needs data-driven insights to understand why employees leave and how to retain top talent.

## Specific Goals
